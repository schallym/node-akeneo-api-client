# Contributor Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

In the interest of fostering an open and welcoming environment, we pledge to make participation in this project and our community a harassment‑free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.
